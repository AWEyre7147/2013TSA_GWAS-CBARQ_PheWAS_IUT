# 2013TSA_GWAS-CBARQ_PheWAS_IUT

This repository hosts data and results from a PheWAS and IUT performed on three Labrador Retriever datasets.  The PheWAS was performed using markers identified in a GWAS from the 2013 TSA cohort where the phenotype of interest was 'behavioral elimination'.  This phenotype represents removal for various behavioral reasons from a 1 year pretraining program where the dogs are tested for eligibility into an olfactory detection program in airports [1].

The PheWAS was performed on three datasets:  an Australian (n=67) cohort of LR pets, a United Kingdom (n=873) cohort of LR pets, and a Seeing Eye (n=1055) cohort of LR guide dogs.  Each of these datasets contained CBARQ questionaires filled out for the dogs and a variable amount of markers available for testing after quality control by PLINK.
